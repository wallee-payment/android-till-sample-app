This project contains Android usage sample code for **Wallee Android Till SDK** library.

## Who is this for?
Merchants that want to build their own Checkout/Till App to run on Android devices like
e.g. the [A920](https://www.pax.us/portfolio_page/a920/)

## What it has?

It has two samples:

- **Till Sample**

    a simple example of a till implementation that makes use of the 'API' client provided by the SDK.

- **Interception Sample**

    an example of a third party application that can register itself as interested in certain transaction events.

## Why would I want to use the SDK
The SDK integrates access to terminal hardware like e.g. the card/stripe/nfc reader
and allows for easy payment processing with wallee.
